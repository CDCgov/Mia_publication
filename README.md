# ***Mia***: Mobile influenza analysis
This repository was created for use by CDC programs to collaborate on public health surveillance related projects in support of the CDC Surveillance Strategy.  Github is not hosted by the CDC, but is used by CDC and its partners to share information and collaborate on software.

This repository contains scripts used for the manuscript *Mitigating Pandemic Risk with Influenza Virus A Field Survillance at a Swine-Human Interface* currently available at [BioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/585588v1) and in submission for peer-review publication. This is currently a beta version and requires substantial dependencies. A containerized version is under active development and when available, a redirect will be available here.

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CDCgov/Mia_publication.git
cd MIA/scripts
sudo bash install.sh
cd -
```

## Dependencies
Everything below is attempted to install with ./MIA/scripts/install.sh.
Due to the large number of dependencies however, there is a decent chance everything will not 
properly install, requiring some manual troubleshooting/install. Setting up the R environment
can be particularly sticky.
